# Hacking Perl 6
I have recently started re-using Perl after a long absence from it. Quite a lot has happened since I last looked at the language, principally:

- Perl 6 has appeared after a very long gestation.
- Perl 5 has undergone major changes/improvements.

Perl 6 looks promising so I am going to start hacking with it and post some scripts as I go along. I am especially interested in its concurrency implementation and will explore this in the future as I learn the language. 

I am also re-visiting Perl 5 to learn some of its new features, especially the Moose extension for OO and the Mojolicious web framework.

I will post scripts and some explanatory blog-type documents here over the coming months.
